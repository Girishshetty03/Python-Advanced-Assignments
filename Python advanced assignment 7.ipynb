    "Ans: There are few assertions that programmer always want to be true to avoid code failure. This type of requirement is fulfilled by assert statement. This statement takes a boolean condition output of which is True, Further Program Executes. if output of assert statement is False, it raises an Assertion Error."

    "Ans: with/as statement simplifies use of file handling in python. When we use a with statement for file reading, there is no need for programmer to explicitly takecare of activities like resource deallocation and file closing by using file.close() method. with statement itself ensures proper acquisition and release of resources. this avoids triggering of exceptions if file closing is unknowingly forgotten in the code execution."
